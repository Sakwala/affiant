# Changelog

All notable changes to the Affiant framework are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
All eight packages (`Affiant.Abstractions`, `Affiant.Core`, `Affiant.SemanticKernel`,
`Affiant.Docket`, `Affiant.EntityFramework`, `Affiant.Policies`, `Affiant.Transport.SignalR`,
`Affiant.Testing.ComplianceHarness`) are versioned in lockstep.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-beta.1] — TBD *(planned; not yet published — the version flip from `alpha.1` happens with the publish step itself)*

First public release. The framework is a deterministic evidence layer for .NET agents:
every AI-proposed database write is a sworn, field-level `Affidavit` reviewed by a human
before it commits.

### Added

- **Eight co-versioned packages** targeting `net10.0`, arranged as a strict DAG rooted at
  `Affiant.Abstractions` (primitive types and interfaces), with `Affiant.Core` (concrete
  services) beneath five adapters — `Affiant.SemanticKernel`, `Affiant.Docket`,
  `Affiant.EntityFramework`, `Affiant.Policies`, `Affiant.Transport.SignalR` — plus
  `Affiant.Testing.ComplianceHarness`.
- **Field-level sworn provenance.** `Affidavit` / `AffidavitField` carry a `ProvenanceChain`
  and `PreviousValue` per field, an `AggregateConfidence`, and the seven-state
  `ProvenanceSource` determinism hierarchy (`UserStated` → `Empty`).
- **`ToolEnvelope`** discriminated return type for all tools — `ReadResult`, `WriteProposal`,
  and `ToolError` — enforcing dual-audience returns and the "write tools never write" rule.
- **Review pipeline.** `ReviewGate` state machine, the durable Docket review queue, Evidence
  Card request/response round-trip, and standing-order / referral / reviewer-confirmation
  approval policies.
- **L2 structured-output inference orchestration** — `ITaskInferenceStrategy` field schemas,
  the task-inference merge step, and per-entity affidavit projection.
- **Tool Descriptor Registry** — declarative write-intent registration via the
  `[AffiantWriteTool]` attribute and `AddAffiantTool<TStrategy>()`.
- **`Affiant.Testing.ComplianceHarness`** — `ComplianceHarness.Verify(...)` proves every
  registered write strategy has a paired fixture asserting substantive provenance, for
  adopters' own CI pipelines.
- Persistence backends for the Docket and sessions: in-memory, SQLite, and PostgreSQL.
- SignalR streaming transport and Evidence Card hub.
- Apache-2.0 licence with `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`; the tool-authoring guide and framework
  specification ship under `docs/`.

### Notes

- Validated by two independent first-party host applications. This is a **beta**: the
  invariant (every field carries provenance) is stable; the public API may change before
  1.0.0 GA.
- All pre-`beta.1` versions (`1.0.0-alpha.1` and earlier) were internal only and were never
  published to nuget.org.
